I'm usually bored by awards-season biopics - the ones that are generally acceptable and safe bets for critics, that usually end up in the lead actor or actress accepting their reward for dressing up and imitating a famous figure. We saw this in films like *Judy*, *Darkest Hour*, and *Bohemian Rhapsody*
